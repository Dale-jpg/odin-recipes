        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons ground thyme</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta shells in boiling water, occasionally stirring, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir mushrooms and garlic in hot oil until mushrooms are soft, about 7 minutes. Stir spinach and thyme into mushroom mixture; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir mixture until spinach wilts. Remove the skillet from heat and drain any excess liquid. Transfer drained mixture to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese with spinach mixture. Season again with salt and pepper and stuff into pasta shells.</li>
        <li>Arrange stuffed shells into a 9x11-inch baking dish. Pour pasta sauce over shells. Top with 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and shells are hot, about 30 minutes.</li>
